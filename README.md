# Represent and capture concept and attribute versioning in geological time scale
A vocabulary that tries to document the different versions of the international geologic time scale. 
There are continuous changes in the international geologic time scale, e.g. adding and removal of concepts, or changes in the attribute of concepts. A semantic model was developed to represent those versioning changes. A case study was done to capture all the changes in the International Chronostratigraphic Chart from 2004 to 2018.
